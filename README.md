 We design a social networking app named as ”Say it on Social” using ScalaPlay framework. The implementation follows the Model-View-Controller pattern. The basic working of the application includes the following functionalities, 
1. A user can register on the web application 
2. A user can login using the correct username and password on the web application 
3. As soon as a user logins the application, he/she can see the explore page with posts posted by the user profiles he/she is following along with the hashtags (topics), he/ she is sub- scribed to. 
4. A user can follow another user profile or subscribe to a topic 
5. A user can share a new post. The post can be an image or text, or combination of both. The only necessary thing is to have a hashtag assigned to a post.
6. A user can see, like and comment on posts. 
7. A user can delete their own post by visiting their profile. 
8. A user can see the explore page in two available sorting options, i.e. Like and Date.
